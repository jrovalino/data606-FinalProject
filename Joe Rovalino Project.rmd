### Part 1 - Introduction
What is your research question?

Which majors/Major categories should a young female choose to increase earning potential and face less competition as a female in the field. 

Why do you care?

The project was prompted from reading the following article "The Economic Guide to Picking A College Major"
Ths was interesting to me on a personal level due to the fact that my niece entered college this year and chose to go to a 2 year college to reduce the loans that she would incur. She did come to me for advice on her next steps and choosing a major. I wasn't really sure what would be the best major she should chose.  This was a very interesting article that prompted my curiousity to get some data driven answers to her. I have shared the article with her and will hopefully find similiar conclusions from the article. 

Why should others care?

There are numerous articles in the papers of our young population having huge debt in the pursuit of a good paying career via education. I feel that if you are going to take away 4-8 years away from your job earning years-it should have a great return on investment (ROI).  As a society, having our young people in debt for something that just gives a very poor ROI is a recipe for a weak and unhapy country in the future.

### Part 2 - Data

The data found on fivethirtyeight.com article:
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/
Data is found here:
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors

Three main data files:
- all-ages.csv
- recent-grads.csv (ages <28)
- grad-students.csv (ages 25+)

All contain basic earnings and labor force information. recent-grads.csv contains a more detailed breakdown, including by sex and by the type of job they got. grad-students.csv contains details on graduate school attendees.  The data set most intereting to my need to get back some info to my niece is the recent-grads.csv.

For the data in datafile -  recent grads under the age of 28, there are 173 majors in the data set.
The response variable is the major code, major and the major category. It is qualitative.
The quantitative independet variables are total, Sample_size, ShareWomen, Employed, Full-time, Part-time, Full_time_year_round, Unemployed, Unemployment_rate, Median, P25th, P75th, College, jobs, Non-college_jobs, Low_wage_job

```{r , echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```



```{r}
# load data
majors <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/all-ages.csv")
head(majors)
#women_stem <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/women-stem.csv")
#head(women_stem)
recentgrads <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/recent-grads.csv")
head(recentgrads)
```


### Part 3 - Exploratory data analysis
```{r}
summary(recentgrads)

top5majorsbyPay<- top_n(recentgrads, 5, Median)
top5majorsbyPay

top5majorswhighunempl <- top_n(recentgrads, 5, Unemployment_rate)
top5majorswhighunempl

# using the sammary function on recent grads. Will create a data frame to only include the majors with a median pay greater than the mean of 40,151
overmeanpayingmajors <- filter(recentgrads, Median > 40151)
#reduces the number of majors to focus on from 173 down to 56
top5wMedian <- top_n(overmeanpayingmajors, 5, Median)
top5wMedian




```
It looks like median unemployement is approximately 20% less for the top 5 majors compared to overall recent grads (0.05561/0.6819). 

It also looks like median Share of Women is approximately 25% less in the top 5 paid majors then compared to overall recent grads (.1328/.5340)


```{r}
summary(recentgrads$Unemployment_rate)
summary(overmeanpayingmajors$Unemployment_rate)
summary(top5wMedian$Unemployment_rate)

ChanceofUnemployment <- cbind(recentgrads$Unemployment_rate, overmeanpayingmajors$Unemployment_rate, top5wMedian$Unemployment_rate)
boxplot(ChanceofUnemployment,names = c("All", "Above Median Pay", "Top5Majors"), ylab = "Unemployment Rate")

summary(recentgrads$ShareWomen)
summary(overmeanpayingmajors$ShareWomen)
summary(top5wMedian$ShareWomen)

ShareofWomen <- cbind(recentgrads$ShareWomen, overmeanpayingmajors$ShareWomen, top5wMedian$ShareWomen)
boxplot(ShareofWomen,names = c("All", "Above Median Pay", "Top5Majors"), ylab = "ShareofWomen")
```
It looks like median unemployement is approximately 20% less for the top 5 majors compared to overall recent grads (0.05561/0.6819). 

It also looks like median Share of Women is approximately 25% less in the top 5 paid majors then compared to overall recent grads (.1328/.5340)

```{r}
options(scipen = 999) 

gg <- ggplot(overmeanpayingmajors, aes(x=ShareWomen, y=Median)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col=ShareWomen, size=Median)) + 
  geom_smooth(method="loess", se=F) 
  labs(subtitle="SHare of Women by Median pay", 
       y="Median Pay", 
       x="Share of Women", 
       title="Scatterplot", 
       caption = "Source: DF overmeanpayingmajors")
  require(scales)
  gg + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) 

plot(gg)

```
The histogram will show a normal distribution unimodal with some slight right skwe. 

```{r}
hist(recentgrads$Median, main = "Median Income for recent grads < 28", xlab = "Median Income for recent grads < 28", col = " navy")
hist(top5wMedian$Median, main = "Median Income for Top5 majors for grads <28", xlab = "Median for top 5 majors for grads <29", col = "dark green")

```


### Part 4 - Inference

This is an observational study of the college majors and the income.  From our textbook, Open Intro Statistics chapter 7.5 Comparing many means wiht ANOVA: 
 "Generally we must check three conditions on the data before performing ANOVA:
 
* the observations are independent within and across groups,

• the data within each group are nearly normal, and

• the variability across the groups is about equal."

```{r}

Majorcategory_mean_variance <- summarize(recentgrads %>% group_by(Major_category), mean = mean(Median))
Majorcategory_mean_variance
                        
```

Looking at the analytis of the group of  major category and it's mean, it appears that the variability across the groups is about equal 

1) We see from the data that each major is indepedent
2) Reviewing the histograms we can see that the distribution of the median salary is a normal distribtion. 
3) check the variability is about equal using and F-Test


Arts, Social Science & Humanities = 1
Arts = 2
Biology and Life Sciences = 3
business = 4
Communications & Journalism = 5
Computers and Mathematics = 6
Education = 7
Engineering = 8
Health = 9
Humanities and Liberal Arts = 10
Industrial Arts and Consumer Services = 11
Indterdisciplinary = 12
Law & Public Policy = 13
Physical Sciences = 14
Psychology and Social Work = 15
Social Science  = 16

Hypothesis null and Hypothesis Alternative - 
H0:  μArts, So  = μ1 = μ2 = μ3 ...= μ16
HA: Median salary varies by major selected. 

```{r}
summary(aov(recentgrads$Median ~ recentgrads$Major_category))
```
Per our textbook (pg 289), we will use the F statistic also called the F-Test to come to a conclusion that the alternative hypothesis is the correct choice as the p value is close to zero (0.0000000000000002). Median salary is not the same across majors. 

### Part 5 - Conclusion

1) Stick to Engineering and Technology - it will lead to higher paying jobs as an undergrad and have the least Share of women. 
2) Looking at ratios of men to women to decide on picking a major may help to stand out as a women. Engineering majors tend to have a low percentage of men to woemen. there are culture trends related to woment diversity inititives like #girlpower and #equalpay. It may be beneficial to try to enter the workforce in a male dominted major as it could be a good way to stand out from other applicants.
